🛡️ SMART EMAIL PRIORITIZER  
Title: Spam & Phishing Detection with Trusted Sender Prioritization

🚀 GOAL  
Build a smart, secure email management tool that:
1. Detects spam and phishing emails using Machine Learning (ML) and/or GPT API.
2. Flags and deprioritizes such emails.
3. Prioritizes emails from a customizable list of trusted senders.
4. Provides a beautiful, responsive UI using glassmorphism, dark themes, and smooth scroll animations.
5. Lets users add or remove trusted senders easily.
6. Optionally supports GPT-based reasoning for deeper analysis and scoring.

🧠 SYSTEM OVERVIEW  

🔍 What it does:
- Accepts raw email input: `sender`, `subject`, `body`.
- Processes the email using:
  a. A simple ML model (TF-IDF + Random Forest or Logistic Regression).
  b. Optionally, the GPT API for phishing risk scoring and explanation.
- Checks whether the sender is on the trusted list.
- Ranks and displays emails in categories:
  ✅ Trusted (high priority)
  ❌ Spam/Phishing (low priority)
  ⚠️ Suspicious (requires review)
- Visual priority and filters enhance user clarity.

🤖 GPT EMAIL ANALYSIS AGENT (PROMPT TEMPLATE)

Use the following structured prompt to analyze emails using GPT-4 or GPT-3.5:

You are an AI email security analyst.

Analyze the following email and respond with:

Phishing Risk Score (0 = safe, 100 = dangerous)

Spam Detection: Is this spam? (Yes/No)

Reasoning (2–3 lines): Explain your decision clearly.

Consider common red flags:

Urgent or threatening tone

Suspicious sender domains

Requests for credentials or personal data

Links or attachments

EMAIL CONTENT:
Subject: {subject}
Sender: {sender}
Body:
{body}

🎯 BACKEND LOGIC (NO CODE, JUST FLOW)

1. Accepts email data via POST request.
   - Input: sender, subject, body
2. Checks if sender exists in the trusted list.
3. If not trusted:
   - Classify using ML model (TF-IDF + classifier).
   - Optionally, run GPT analysis.
4. Label email as:
   - ✅ Trusted
   - ❌ Spam / Phishing
   - ⚠️ Suspicious
5. Return classification, risk score, and optional GPT reasoning to frontend.

🎨 FRONTEND DESIGN (MODERN & JUDGES-IMPRESSIVE)

📥 Inbox Layout:
- Scrollable vertical list (like Gmail)
- Email cards with hover effect and status icon
- Filter bar: All | Trusted | Suspicious | Spam

🧊 Glassmorphic Card Design:
- Background: `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1)`
- Blur effect: `backdrop-filter: blur(15px)`
- Smooth rounded corners, shadowed cards
- Icons for status: ✅ ⚠️ ❌
- Subtle transitions on hover and click

🌚 Dark Mode Theme:
```css
background: linear-gradient(to right, #0f2027, #203a43, #2c5364);
color: #ffffff;
🎞️ Animations (subtle, smooth):

Use AOS.js or Framer Motion for:

Email card entry animations

Filter transitions

Slide/fade panels

⚙️ Trusted Senders Panel:

Floating side drawer

Add/remove trusted emails

Live preview of trust-based filtering

📊 Stats Dashboard (Optional):

Total emails

% flagged as spam

% trusted

Average GPT risk score

📈 GPT-ONLY MODE (Optional Simpler Path)

Skip ML model training.

All email evaluations go through GPT.

GPT provides:

Risk score

Spam status

Justification

Add a "GPT is analyzing…" animation during API call.

🟢 Pros: Simpler, no ML code
🔴 Cons: Slightly slower, requires more GPT calls

🧪 TEST CASE EXAMPLES

Sender	Subject	Expected Tag
updates@paypal-login.com	"Urgent: Your account is locked!"	❌ Phishing
yourfriend@gmail.com	"Lunch tomorrow?"	✅ Trusted/Safe
unknown@weirdpromo.site	"You won an iPhone!"	❌ Spam
mentor@school.edu	"Project feedback attached"	✅ Trusted (manual)

🚀 DEPLOYMENT OPTIONS

Frontend:

Use Vercel or Netlify (simple React build)

Backend:

Use Render, Railway, or Replit for Flask hosting

GPT API:

Store API key in .env securely

Use rate limiting to prevent overuse during testing

🏆 FEATURES THAT WILL IMPRESS JUDGES

✅ Clean UI with modern visual effects
✅ Live GPT reasoning (shows "why" an email was flagged)
✅ Trusted sender customization
✅ Animations and scroll effects (smooth experience)
✅ Dashboard: Real-time email stats
✅ Well-structured backend + readable frontend
✅ Option to download report as PDF (bonus)
✅ GPT fallback when ML model confidence is low (hybrid intelligence)

💡 BONUS IDEAS (IF TIME ALLOWS)

Add authentication (Firebase or Auth0)

Add audio alerts for phishing

Highlight risky phrases inside the email body

Add a search bar to filter by sender/subject

Let user “train” the ML model by tagging emails manually

🎓 FINAL REMARK

Build something functional, beautiful, and insightful.
Focus on storytelling during your demo:

“This is your inbox. This is how it protects you.”
